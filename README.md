# Selma
---
selma is virtual assistant built by Algerian engineers in **2018** to  control different appliances in your home over bluetooth low energy this project touches used diffrent technologies such as **dialogflow TensorFlow RxJava bluetooth low energy** so to get started let's have look on the project architecture

## dimmer:
the dimmer is built around **nrf51822 beacon** which can be controled by using **bluetooth low energy** the electrical scheme of the dimmer is illustrated if the figure bellow

the code source of the dimmer you can find it [here](https://github.com/ceristTeam/Dimmer dimmer), to get started with bluetooth low energy you can check these  posts on medium [first part](https://medium.com/mindorks/bluetooth-low-energy-3656ac323c4e) and the [seconde part](https://medium.com/mindorks/bluetooth-low-energy-on-raspberry-second-part-516b5e8ad7c2)
